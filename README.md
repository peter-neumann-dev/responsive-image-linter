## 🚀 What it does

The extension is an alternative for the original [RespImageLint](https://github.com/ausi/respimagelint)
bookmarklet, but uses the original code from it. Due to some browsers or used
privacy settings, bookmarklets can't be used. This extension is a workaround for
this problem.

Instead of running on click on your bookmark, it will run the checks on click of
the extension icon and execute the same checks as the bookmarklet and display
the results at [ausi.github.io/respimagelint](https://ausi.github.io/respimagelint).
